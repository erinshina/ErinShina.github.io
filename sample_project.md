## Massachusetts Education Analysis

> “Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom.” ― Oprah Winfrey

My 10-year high school reunion was in 2022. It's unbelievable to me that it's been so long, and I've been reflecting on my public school experience. I was very lucky to attend good schools throughout my life, and had a lot of priviledge in my educational experience. In a school district as large as JCPS in Louisville, KY, it can be difficult to understand differences in data across schools and understand what it means. 

In this project, I used Tableau to analyze and visualize data from another school district in Massachusetts from 2017. The task was to design a dashboard and answer the following for the superintendent: 
- Which schools are struggling the most? 
- How does class size affect college admission? 
- What are the top math schools in the state?

### The Data
This data comes from the **Massachusetts Department of Education** reports from 2017. You can find it [**here.**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data?select=MA_Public_Schools_datadict.csv) There are 1,861 rows in the dataset, and relevant columns include:
- class size
- graduation rates
- college attendance
- economic disadvantage
- math test scores for multiple grades

## Key Insights
1. The lowest-performing high schools have graduation rates **less than 20%**, though the state average is **83%.**
2. Class size and college attendance do not appear to be correlated. There is a negative correlation between **economic disadvantage and college attendance.**
3. 

Be sure to follow *The Interesting Project Template* as shown in [**The Data Science Project Studio**](https://www.datacareerjumpstart.com/products/the-data-science-project-studio/categories/2150357707/posts/2158441592). 

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
